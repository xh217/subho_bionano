# svarrange
An R package for identifing complex genomic region and their hierarchical organization from optical mapping genome sequencing

## Getting Started

We recommend an R version 3.6.0 or more recent in order to use the package.

## Introduction
Complex genomic rearrangements are common rare in normal tissues but a majority of the tumor genomes have extensive rearrangements, including complex events. Until other classes of genomic alterations, complex rearrangements in tumors are least characterized due to technological limitations, which has led to debates about their architectures and etiologies. Here, we assess the application of genome-graph concept utilizing deep coverage.

## Availability and Installation
The development version of svarrange package is available at https://github.com/sjdlabgroup/svarrange and can be installed as
```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sjdlabgroup/svarrange ",build_vignettes = FALSE )
```
## svarrange workflow

Step 1. Aligned each mapID contig with the reference genome and binned the mapping mapID contig with a resolution of 10kb 

Step 2. Retrieve all mapID contigs that mapping to the same seed bin and clustered mapID contigs and defined a complex haplotype as having at least four mapID contigs to the same reference chromosome position.

Step 3. Utilized the BNLearn algorithm to trace the origin and trajectory of the segment junctions.

```

## Step 1. Aligned each mapID contig with the reference genome and binned the mapping mapID contig with a resolution of 10kb 
    
Details

Aligned each mapID contig with the reference genome and binned the mapping mapID contig with a resolution of 10kb, utilizing the same version of the reference genome as used in the bionano analysis. The reference genome was binned with a 10kb resolution. The output includes all the bins that are covered by each mapID, along with the corresponding mapIDs that have overlapping regions in the reference genome. The output consists of two columns: the first column displays the included reference bins, and the second column lists the mapIDs associated with those reference bins.
    
Examples
 
library(GenomicRanges)
library(data.table)
genome_bin <- data(genome.10kb.bed)
xmap <- data(xmap)
combine_tmp <- overlap_bin_mapID(genome_bin,xmap,window_size=10000)

head(combine_tmp)
     V1        type_merge
1  C1_1 26572,26622,17811
4  C1_2 26572,26622,17811
7  C1_3 26572,26622,17811
10 C1_4 26572,26622,17811
13 C1_5 26572,26622,17811
16 C1_6 26572,26622,17811

Examples

library(stringr)
complex_event<-cplx_events(combine_tmp,4)

head(complex_event$blocks[[1]])
[1] "C1_1634" "C1_1635" "C1_1636" "C1_1637" "C1_1638" "C1_1639"

head(complex_event$contigs[[1]])
[1] "152"   "172"   "22361" "23532" "23541" "26061"

## Step 3. Utilized the BNLearn algorithm to trace the origin and trajectory of the segment junctions.

Details

Complex genomic regions are frequent occurrences that drive the development of cancer. However, identifying somatic complex genomic regions has proven to be a challenging task. By employing Optical mapping, structural variations (SVs) can be successfully detected on the same DNA fiber, indicating their tandem occurrence on a single/mutiple chromosomes. This enabled to pinpoint the segment junctions between these tandem SVs. During the investigation using BNG analysis, we observed the presence of multiple heterogeneous DNA contigs, referred to as complex regions (inferred by step 2), all aligning to the same location on the reference genome. We were able to extract all the segment junctions from these regions, and these junctions appeared to be closely associated with the initiation of large-scale rearrangement events across multiple chromosomes.

i) extract segment junctions between tandem mapID

Examples

library(GenomicRanges)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(gtools)
library(tidyr)

xmap <- data(xmap)
cov <- data(xmap_coverage)

event=26  
single_complex_event<-complex_event$contigs[[event]]
single_complex_df<-xmap[which(xmap$V1 %in% one_complex_event),] 
single_complex_junction<-extract_junctions(single_complex_df)

head(single_complex_junction)
  mapID              note
1 22671 C7_14420|C7_14429
3 22671 C7_14430|C7_14438
4 22672 C7_14423|C7_14429
5 22672 C7_14420|C7_14429
6 22672 C7_14428|C7_14438
7 22672 C7_14432|C7_14438

ii) add coverage data for each mapID and generate trajectory plot

#extract junction for each complex event,The vector 'single_complex_junction' must not be empty

single_complex_junction<-separate(single_complex_junction, col=note, into=c('junc1', 'junc2'), sep='\\|')
colnames(single_complex_junction)<-c("V1","V2","V3")

#extract coverage for each complex event

single_complex_cov<-unique(cov[which(cov$mapID %in% unique(single_complex_junction$V1)),c("mapID","cov")])

#extract bins and mapIDs for each complex event

single_complex_combine_tmp<-overlap_bin_mapID(genome_bin,single_complex_df, window_size=10000)
one_complex_event<-cplx_events(single_complex_combine_tm,4)
res<-order.of.events(cplx_list=one_complex_event,bpdf=one_complex_junction,covdf=one_complex_cov,cplx.event=1, optimization="pc.stable")

#make trajectory plot
traj_plot <- ooe.plot(res)
```
